## Competition name: House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

### Competition Description
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence. [https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data]. The idea of this competition is to predict the price based on the given features.

The dataset consists of 80 different features and based on this feature we need to predicts the price of houses. There are two dataset _train.csv_ and _test.csv._ We need to build a model that will trained through the training data and then it will predict the Sale Price for the test data. The result need to submitted to Kaggle to get the score and the ranking in the leaderboard(LB).
